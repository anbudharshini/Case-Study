🚗 CAR RENTAL SYSTEM

📘 Introduction
------------------
The Car Rental System is a terminal-based Python + MySQL application designed to manage vehicle leasing operations.
It provides a menu-driven interface for efficiently handling customer records, leasing workflows, vehicle inventory, and payment transactions.
The system uses an object-oriented, modular design and connects with a MySQL database to persist and retrieve data.

🎯 Project Objective
------------------------
To create a backend application that manages core operations for a vehicle rental business — including customer onboarding, lease management, vehicle handling, and payment tracking — using a layered architecture.

⚙️ How It Works
-------------------
The system launches with a CLI-based menu from main.py.
